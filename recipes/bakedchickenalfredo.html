    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      This recipe is quick and easy and any novice cook can do it. It was made
      for the little ones who always wanted to order out at Pizza Hut® or Olive
      Garden®. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. This recipe can
      also be eaten without being baked but the kids love that it resembles
      baked casseroles found in restaurants.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 chicken breasts, patted dry</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add minced
        garlic; saute until golden, about 30 seconds. Stir in cream cheese until
        smooth. Add milk; stir until there are no lumps. Lower heat to medium.
        Add 3/4 of the Parmesan cheese, parsley, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon
        salt, and black pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is
        smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season chicken with 1/2
        teaspoon salt and garlic powder on both sides. Cook chicken breasts
        until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C),
        about 6 minutes per side. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Butter bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cover bottom with
        a layer of pasta. Place half of the chicken cubes on top. Pour 1/2 of
        the sauce over the chicken. Repeat layering pasta, chicken, and sauce.
        Sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes.
        Remove aluminum foil and bake until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes
        more.
      </li>
    </ol>
